1.About:
Caro, also called five-in-a-row, is a popular Vietnamese logic game. Game rule is similar to Tic-Tac-Toe; however, a player needs 5 move in a row to win instead of 3, and the board on which the game is played on can be of any size, not just a 3-by-3 board. Players take turn placing moves on available spaces on a grid, and whoever reach 5 moves consecutively (in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction) first win the game. 

This game is popular among Vietnamese students in between classes, on spare paper in notebooks. Therefore, the board size is not limited and can be any size.
